# ML_study_note
This repository is to organize what I learned about machine learning

## How to start
* [how to read papers](https://aistory4u.tistory.com/entry/%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-%EB%85%BC%EB%AC%B8-%ED%9A%A8%EA%B3%BC%EC%A0%81%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C-%EC%9D%BD%EB%8A%94-%EB%B2%95-%E2%80%94-%EC%9E%85%EB%AC%B8%EC%9E%90%ED%8E%B8)  
  + Just see Title-Abstrat-Experiment categories of the paper  
  + When seeing experiment, focus on the graphs, images

## Machine Learning Basics
* [Youtube video that explains mathematical concepts about ml](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA)

### Concepts
* [classification problems vs regression problems](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761)
* [supervised learning vs unsupervised learning]()

### Models
* [k-nearest neighbor classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761)

## Image processing
### academic papers
* [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872)
  + pros
    - Doesn't need hand-designed components
    - Doesn't need specialized library
  + [Explanation](https://deep-learning-study.tistory.com/748)
